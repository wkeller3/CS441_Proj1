The app is a Unit Converter. You are able to convert between inches, feet, yards, centimeters, and meters. To use it, select the first spinner and choose what unit you want to convert from. Next, select the second spinner to choose what you want to convert to. After selecting the units you enter your number into the EditText box and hit convert.

Once convert is hit the number is converted into the correct unit and displayed in the middle of the screen with 2 decimal places. If you wish to change this you can select either of the two buttons on the bottom to either add a decimal place or get rid of a decimal place. The app supports any number of decimal places from 0 to 6.

I decided to add the buttons to change the number of decimal places because a lot of times, you just need it rounded to a certain place (usually the hundredths place, which is why that is the default).
